# Project Overview 🔎
The project was a basic implementation of the card game Bridge, as part of a first semester University assignment on the class Fundamentals of Programming.

# What I learned💡
As one of the first experiences on programming the project  was a great opportunity to start coding and learn programming foundamental principles.
It was also the first interaction with C programming language, providing low level code understanding, using pointers and primitive data types.

# Technical info ⚙️
As mentioned, C programming language was used.
The inputs of the program as well as the outputs displayed, where determined according to the needs of the project's presentation our class Instructor provided us.
